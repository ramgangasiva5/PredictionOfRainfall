The artefact that is being presented in this document is complete code that has been
researched for this Project: where the results can be used to build a model or application that
would predict occurrence of rainfall In Australia. The artefact can help metrological society to
understand the occurrence of rainfall and give an accurate prediction. This could also help
common person to be prepared beforehand for the rain. This would help farmers a lot for
agriculture and water storage for future use. This would help even airport authorities.
